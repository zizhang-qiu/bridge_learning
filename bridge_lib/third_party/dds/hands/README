The text files in this directory are all input files for the
test program.  Clearly large files take longer to run.

For the curious, the hands are as below.

masterDD.txt
------------
The superset of all text files other than thomas1.txt and 
thomas2.txt.  It consists of Richard Pavlicek's collection of
hands from top-level play (which in turn comes from another source), 
as well as many of the hands that Soren Hein played with his 
partner online over a five-year period.

Of the 83,691 individual hands, by far most of them are from
Pavlicek's archives.  About 5-6,000 of them are Soren's play,
many of them with results from the other table as well.

Overall this database has a fair amount of duplicated hands
played at more than one table, though clearly less than 50%.
In that sense it is a good test of the duplication recognition
in DDS.

These are just excerpts from the larger masterDD.txt file.


largest.txt
-----------
These are 21 hands from masterDD.txt that take a particularly
long time to solve.

thomas1.txt
thomas2.txt
-----------
These are artificially constructed hands that take a very long
time to solve.

sol100000.txt
sol10.txt
-------------
These are hands with CalcTable solutions.  I think they came from
an original DDS test program.
