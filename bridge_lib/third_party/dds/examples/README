There are a number of simple examples for individual DDS functions.

Copy the Makefile for your system from the Makefiles folder.

Then make the example you want,

make CalcDDtable
./CalcDDtable

This requires the DLL to be in the directory.  It will get there
when you do a "make install" in the src directory after compiling
the DLL there.
